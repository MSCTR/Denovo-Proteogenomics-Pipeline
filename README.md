## Introduction
DeNoPro provides a pipeline for the identification of novel peptides from matched RNAseq and MS/MS proteomics data. 

Paired or singled end reads are first assembled using Trinity and six-frame translated. This output is used to create a custom peptide database using SearchGUI, which can then be mapped against proteomics data.
